Project Highlight: Building a RESTful API with Spring Boot & Hibernate
I recently worked on creating a RESTful API that inserts data into a database using the Spring MVC architecture.
🔧 Tech Stack Used:
🛠️ Spring Boot
📦 Hibernate (ORM)
🌐 RESTful Web Services
🧰 STS (Spring Tool Suite)
📌 Key Features:
API endpoints built with Spring MVC
Data persistence using Hibernate
Proper separation of concerns (Controller-Service-Repository)
Clean code structure following best practices
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of backend development, data flow, and ORM handling using Hibernate.
